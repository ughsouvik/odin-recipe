        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Add 2 cups of sugar and 2 cups of water in a pan.
            </li>
            <li>Boil it on a high flame for about 5 mins.
            </li>
            <li>When the sugar dissolves in water, keep stirring and boiling it on low flame.
            </li>
            <li>After 6 to 8 minutes the [i]chasni[/i] will be ready. Hold this thick mixture between your two fingers. If a single string is formed as you separate your fingers, the sugar syrup is ready.
            </li>
            <li>Let it cool for 5 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>In the authentic Joynagrer Moa recipe, the jaggery [i](nolen gur)[/i] is mixed in equal quantity with sugar to form this string.
            </li>
            <li>Now add [i]Kanakchur Khoi[/i] slowly in the sugar syrup and keep stirring.
            </li>
            <li>After mixing thoroughly, cover it very well with a cloth or a lid and keep it for minimum 10 hours or overnight.
            </li>
            <li>Next morning, remove the lid and add grated Khoya kheer. Mix it very well.
            </li>
            <li>Now add 1/2 tsp of the cardamom powder and 1 teaspoon ghee. Mix it very well.
            </li>
            <li>Make small balls by this mixture to shape it like Joynagarer Moa.
            </li>
            <li>Now spread the dry khoya kheer on the top of all Joynagarer Moas.
            </li>
            <li>Garnish the Joynagarer Moa with a Raisin each.
            </li>
            <li>Seasonal Bengali Sweet Recipe Joynagarer Moa is ready to serve

            <li>It may not be the authentic one if you dont have Jolen Gur, but it is closer with Sugar and lot of sweetness while making.
