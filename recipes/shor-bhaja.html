      <h1>Shor Bhaja</h1>
      <p>
        Krishna Nagar (Nadia, West Bengal, India) is the birth place of Shor
        Bhaja. It is purely made of cream of the milk. Sometimes khoya and
        chenna are also mixed with it. It follows one of the most difficult and
        tedious processes of making sweets. It needs extreme patience and expert
        skills. There is a similar kind of sweet named Shorpuria or sarpuria.
        The only difference is that for sarpuriya the cakes made of milk
        cream(shor) are baked instead of deep frying.

        <li>Vegetable oil: 1½ – 2 cups</li>
        <li>
          Caster sugar: 1 tbsp (I couldn’t find them handy so I used normal

        </li>
        <li>All-purpose flour: ½ tsp (if required)</li>
        <li>Lemon: 1/6thof a regular lemon</li>
        <li>Pistachio: slivers for decoration</li>
        <li>
          Khoya/ milk powder: 1 tsp for decoration (use whichever is available
          at home)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ol>
        <li>
          In a pan heat water and sugar. Boil until it comes to single thread
          consistency. Remove from flame and set it aside.
        </li>
        <li>In another pan bring milk to boil.</li>
        <li>
          Keep on low flame and when the cream becomes a firm layer on top, push
          it to the edge of the pan.
        </li>
        <li>
          Keep on doing this until the cream layer collected at the sides is
          dry.
        </li>
        <li>Remove it and place it on a plate.</li>
        <li>
          Keep on repeating this and placing the collected cream on top of the
          previous layer until the whole batch of milk is over.
        </li>
        <li>Shape the cream into a square block.</li>
        <li>Slice it into small squares.</li>
        <li>
          Fry them until golden in ghee. Keep flame medium else the pieces will
          burn.
        </li>
        <li>Remove them from ghee and add them to the syrup.</li>
        <li>Let them soak for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove from the syrup, garnish with pistachios and serve.</li>
      </ol>
