    <h1>Patishapta</h1>
    <p>This stuffed pancake roll is preserved for Makar Sankranti, and is always made at home. Stuffed with a coconut and jaggery mix, it's typically had warm because the filling doesn't quite do the trick otherwise. The pancake batter is made with maida (all purpose flour), semolina, and rice flour, and is mixed with milk. And it has to be really thin too. In many homes, the filling is made with sugar instead of jaggery, which isn't my favourite kind. Some even drizzle a bit of sweet thickened milk on top of the roll before serving.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup Refined flour / maida</li>
        <li>1/2 cup Sooji (semolina)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup Rice flour</li>
        <li>1.1/2 - 2 cups Milk</li>
        <li>To cook Oil</li>
        <li>3 cups Coconut / khoya, grated</li>
        <li>2 tbsp Sugar / date jaggery</li>
        <li>3-4 Green cardamoms
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a wok mix grated coconut or khoya with sugar or jaggery and place it over low flame. If making with khoya, add little milk.</li>
        <li>Add cardamom in it.</li>
        <li>Keep stirring the mixture till it gets sticky. Keep aside to cool. The process will take 15-20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Take maida, sooji and rice flour in a bowl.</li>
        <li>Add milk. Mix it carefully not making any lumps. Keep the mixture for half an hour.</li>
        <li>Heat the non stick pan. Put a little oil. Pour a thin layer of the mixture on it and spread it quickly with the laddle.</li>
        <li>Put the filling lengthwise at the center of it and roll it. Wait till the colour is light brown.</li>
        <li>Place it on the plate. Serve hot or cold.</li>
        <li>You can pour condensed milk over it before serving.</li>
    </ol>
