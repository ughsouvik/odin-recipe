<h1>Langcha</h1>
<p>To be true to this sweet, you have to call it Shaktigarh-er Langcha, because it's credited to have originated from this town in Burdwan district of West Bengal. This elongated deep-fried sweet made with chhana, khoya and flour, with bits of cardamom in it, and like most fried sweets, soaked in sugar syrup, the Langcha is now made all over Calcutta. But the signature recipe of Shaktigarh remains. Incidentally, it's quite similar in taste to the Pantua, which is of course shaped like a ball of sponge.</p>
