<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>500 gm khoya</li>
    <li>1 1/2 litre milk
    </li>
    <li>15 strand saffron
    </li>
    <li>powdered green cardamom as required
    </li>
    <li>2 cup sugar
    </li>
    <li>4 teaspoon icing sugar
    </li>
    <li>grated coconut as required
    </li>
    <li>water as required
    </li>
    <li>4 drops edible food color
    </li>
    <li>2 tablespoon lemon juice
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>To begin with, take a deep bottomed pan and put it on medium flame. Pour milk in the pan and bring it to a boil, then add lemon juice in the pan and prepare the chenna. Then using a strainer, extract the chenna in a bowl and knead it to make a soft dough.

    </li>
    <li>Now, part the dough into small portions and roll it into small balls resembling a rasgulla. Keep them aside until needed again.

    </li>
    <li>Meanwhile, take another deep-bottomed pan and put it on medium flame. Add water in it followed by sugar and bring the mixture to a boil and cook it until you get one string like consistency. Add in the saffron (Kesar) and red edible colour to this mixture. Stir to prepare nice red sugar syrup and turn off the flame.

    </li>
    <li>Soak the prepared rasgulla (see step-2 for reference) in the sugar syrup and allow it to cook in the sugar syrup.

    </li>
    <li>Meanwhile, to prepare the outer coating, take a non-stick pan and put in on medium flame. Add khoya in the pan and cook the khoya until it changes its colour to brownish. Add in grated coconut (finely grated) followed by adding cardamom powder in the pan. Once done, prepare flat circles resembling a puri from the khoya mixture and keep them aside.

    </li>
    <li>After that, remove the soaked rasgulla from the saffron-sugar mixture using a strainer. Add in the prepared rasgulla in the khoya puri (outer coating) (see step-5) and secure it. Repeat the same process with the remaining rasgullas.

    </li>
    <li>Once done, mix together the grated coconut and icing sugar in a plate and roll the prepared rasgullas in the mixture. Refrigerate these rasgullas for about an hour. Bengali Kheer Kadam is ready to eat. Enjoy!
